Tank Wars v3.2

Artwork by Camron Wilson
Game design and implementation
   by Camron Wilson and Walker Dauphin

Collecting a powerup grants the user
the ability to alt fire, shooting
a powerful beam to destroy all tanks
in its path instantly.

The settings can be edited for
an "extra" gamemode that changes
the powerup ability to be faster
firing rather than a beam.
